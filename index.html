            Few visible traces remain of the ancient inhabitants of Surrey. Two fine Bronze Age “barrows” or burial mounds  can be seen at Horsell Common in Woking and there are the remains of Iron Age hillforts at Hascombe Hill, Chertsey, and St George’s Hill in Weybridge. Probably the best for visitors is the hill fort at Holmbury Hill, especially as the site enjoys fabulous views of the surrounding countryside.

            The Romans created one of their major roads in the early years of their occupation connecting Chichester with London known as Stane Street. The modern A3 and A24 roads follow this route. They also built temples near Wanborough and Farley Heath. You can visit the site of the latter, and see a beautiful Priest’s head-dress from Wanborough at Guildford Museum.

            The Saxons came to Surrey in the 5th and 6th centuries and the names of their tribes live on in modern place names such as Woking and Godalming. “Surrey” itself comes from the Saxon term Suthrige, or "southern kingdom". Surrey was largely protected from attacks by the Vikings due to its position inland, however the invaders were defeated at Farnham in 892 by the army of Edward the Elder. Kingston was the site of the coronation of English kings during the following century, including Aethelstan and Aethelred the Unready.
            The Coronation Stone can be seen on the High Street by Clattern Bridge.

                Following the Norman conquest, William de Warenne  was given the title “Earl of Surrey”, and significant castles at Guildford and Farnham were built - both can be visited today. The first Cistercian monastery in England, Waverley Abbey, was founded in 1128 in Farnham. The buildings survived many floods but felt into disrepair following the dissolution of the monasteries during the reign of Henry VIII. The ruins are now managed by Historic England and are open to the public.

                One of the most significant events in world history took place in a quiet meadow in Surrey in June 1215, when King John reluctantly sealed Magna Carta at Runnymede.

                The proximity to London, and the abundance of hunting grounds resulted in the building of some magnificent royal palaces in Surrey during the Tudor period. Of these, only Hampton Court remains intact, but there were sumptuous residences at Richmond and at Ewell, where Nonsuch Palace was built on a spectacular scale for Henry VIII. He did not live to see it completed, although it was much used and loved by Elizabeth I. Sadly Nonsuch survived for less than 140 years.
                Charles II gave it to his mistress, Barbara Villiers, Countess of Castlemaine, who had it pulled down in 1682-3 and sold to pay off her gambling debts! Some of the fixtures, including oak panelling, were reused in the Great Hall at Loseley Park.  Nonsuch Mansion, a Georgian house on the park is now largely used as a wedding venue and contains a museum which is open to the public along with extensive gardens.

                Woking Palace was created by Henry VII from a 13th Century house. It was further developed during the reigns of both Henry VIII and by Elizabeth I and remained in royal hands until 1620, when James I granted it to one of his courtiers. The palace was largely demolished and the materials used elsewhere. The site, with its picturesque ruins and tranquil moated setting is definitely worth visiting and guided walks can be booked at times during the year.
                <br><br>
                Surrey's mainly rural economy had revolved mainly around the woolen cloth industry although this came to an end during the Tudor period. A new industrial era came into being in the 17th century centred on the Tillingbourne valley, which runs from Leith Hill to join the river Wey at Guildford. During the 17th century this area was the main producer of gunpowder in England. One of the country’s first canal systems, the Wey Navigation, opened in 1653. It enabled gunpowder, timber, wood, corn and flour to be transported up to London and coal to be brought back to power the mills.
                The waterways are now purely for leisure use and you can enjoy boat trips organised by the Wey and Arun Canal Trust.
                <br><br>
                The county continued to be largely rural and sparsely populated until transport improved during the 19th Century, and in particular with the arrival of the railways. This enabled the process of commuting and with it a dramatic growth in building, population and wealth.  It affected existing towns like Guildford and Farnham and created new towns such as Redhill and Woking. The transformation of Surrey continued into the 20th Century with the creation of the M25 orbital motorway and the building of both Gatwick and Heathrow airports on either side of the county, enabling easy access to visitors from overseas.

## Project Overview

This project allows users to select hotels to stay at, places of interest to visit and outdoor places to explore with or out-with families. Once the user has selected the places they want to stay at, the places they want to visit and the activities they want to do these can be emailed to the user for future reference. The users will be able to see on Google Maps where the places they have selected are.

## UX

This website is for anyone young and old who would like to find hotels to stay at, places of interest to visit and places to go to explore the great outdoors. Once the user has made their choices they can be emailed for future reference. The user doesn’t have to select options from all three categories. They could select only one if they like.

* As a user, I want to perform the following action. Select hotels to stay at.

Use Google Maps to view the hotels that are available, and if there is more than one hotel in a given area, the user can click on it and zoom in to show all of the hotels in that area. Then the user can choose one, click on it and display the information about it. Once the user is happy, the user can click on the tick box to copy the hotel(s) into the section below called Your selection to start building the itinerary. If the user decides the hotel(s) are no longer wanted, then they can be unselected and removed, and the process can start again.

* As a user, I want to perform the following action. Select places of interest to visit.

Use Google Maps to view the places of interest that are available, and if there is more than one place of interest in a given area, the user can click on it, zoom in and show all of the places of interest in that area. Then the user can choose one, click on it and display the information about it. Once the user is happy, the user can click on the tick box to copy the places of interest into the section below called Your selection to start building the itinerary. If the user decides the places of interest are no longer wanted, then they can be unselected and removed, and the process can start again.

* As a user, I want to perform the following action. Select places to explore the great outdoors.

Use Google Maps to view the places to explore that are available, and if there is more than one place(s) to explore in a given area, the user can click on it, zoom in and show all of the place(s) to explore in that area. Then the user can choose one, click on it and display the information about it. Once the user is happy, the user can click on the tick box to copy the place(s) to explore into the section below called Your selection to start building the itinerary. If the user decides the place(s) to explore are no longer wanted, then they can be unselected and removed, and the process can start again.

* As a user, I want to perform the following action. Email the selected options to the user.

Once the user is happy with all of the options they can be emailed to the user, by clicking on the Email itinerary button, typing in the email address and clicking the send button. The options will be copied into the email, which will be set up with a suitable template.

* As a user, I want to perform the following action. To be able to access the website on a smartphone or tablet.

The user will need to be able to use the website without any problems on a medium to small screen so the layout will need to be thought out.

## Technologies Used

### HTML

I have used HTML5 to create the website.

### CSS3

I have used CSS3 to add colour and style to the website, and to help format it to help it fit on different screen sizes

### Bootstrap

I have used Bootstrap to allow the website to become responsive for different screen sizes and to add the navigation menu

[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)

### JavaScript

### JQuery

### Font Awesome

I used Font Awesome to use an icon for the favicon and other places in the project.

## Testing

If there is a look of testing can use a seperate file called testing.md

Test all parts and write about what happens if something goes wrong, what the expected result is, what happens when the user, uses it

## Deployment

To be able to test my website on Windows, MacOS, IOS and android, and on Google Chrome, Safari, Microsoft Edge, Opera and Mozilla Firefox I deployed my website to GitHub Pages. This allowed me to use the web site address on smartphones, tablets, Windows laptops and desktops, without having to log into Gitpod and open the project and run the local web server.

To deploy the website, I followed these steps

1.  Log into my GitHub account
2.  Click on the link on the left-hand side for my milestone2 project
3.  Click on the Settings button, which is the last button on the row of buttons near the top of the page
4.  Scroll down to the GitHub Pages section
5.  At the top of the GitHub Pages section there are the Source options
6.  In this section click on the dropdown menu called Branch and selected master
7.  Then click on the Save button
8.  The published link then appears just above the source options, which is https://paulday966.github.io/milestone2/
9.  Clicking on this link launches my website in the same tab

To deploy my project using the clone option I would follow these steps

Option 1 Clone with HTTPS

1.  Log into my GitHub account
2.  Click on the link on the left-hand side for my milestone2 project
3.  Make sure the <> Code button is selected, which will have a red line underneath it
4.  Click on the button labelled Code with two downward facing arrows on it. This button is next the green Gitpod button
5.  The first clone option will allow you to Clone with HTTPS and gives me the following link: https://github.com/paulday966/milestone2.git

When accessing the project with https:// the clone URLs are available on all repositories, regardless of visibility. https:// clone URLs work even if you are behind a firewall or proxy. When using git commands such as clone, fetch, pull and push the username and password are required.

Option 2 Clone with SSH

1.  Log into my GitHub account
2.  Click on the link on the left-hand side for my milestone2 project
3.  Make sure the <> Code button is selected, which will have a red line underneath it
4.  Click on the button labelled Code with two downward facing arrows on it. This button is next the green Gitpod button
5.  A message appears just above the link which says the following. You don’t have any public SSH keys in your GitHub account. You can add a new public key, or try cloning this repository via HTTPS
6.  The second clone option will allow you to Clone with SSH and gives me the following link: git@github.com:paulday966/milestone2.git

Using this option gives the user access to the Git repository via SSH, which is a secure protocol. As mentioned in step 5 this option can only be used after creating an SSH keypair on the computer and add the public key to the GitHub account. When using git command such as clone, fetch, pull and push to access the repository the password must be entered along with the SSH key passphrase.

Option 3 Clone with GitHub CLI

1.  Log into my GitHub account
2.  Click on the link on the left-hand side for my milestone2 project
3.  Make sure the <> Code button is selected, which will have a red line underneath it
4.  Click on the button labelled Code with two downward facing arrows on it. This button is next the green Gitpod button
5.  The third clone option will allow you to Clone with GitHub CLI and gives me the following link: gh repo clone paulday966/milestone2

To open my project using the Open with GitHub Desktop option I would follow these steps

1.  Log into my GitHub account
2.  Click on the link on the left-hand side for my milestone2 project
3.  Make sure the <> Code button is selected, which will have a red line underneath it
4.  Click on the button labelled Code with two downward facing arrows on it. This button is next the green Gitpod button
5.  Clicking on the second option will allow you to Open with GitHub Desktop. If you don't have the program installed it will take you to a webpage where you will be given the option to download and install correct version of the program for your operating system

To download my code in a ZIP file so I can open and run the project locally I would follow these steps

1.  Log into my GitHub account
2.  Click on the link on the left-hand side for my milestone2 project
3.  Make sure the <> Code button is selected, which will have a red line underneath it
4.  Click on the button labelled Code with two downward facing arrows on it. This button is next the green Gitpod button
5.  Click on the third option called Download ZIP
6.  The files will now download to your machine in a ZIP file so they can be accessed locally

### External hosting

External hosting for this project is not required as GitHub can generate a website link in the GitHub Pages deployment section. This link allows me to access the website on mobile devices and desktops wherever and whenever I want.
I'm able to use GitHub to host this project as it doesn't have a database or similar connected to it and only has static and interactive pages. This will save a lot of time as I don't have to go through the process of selecting an external hosting company, setting up an account and making sure the site gets transferred across properly and set up. One big advantage of using GitHub is that it is free to use.

## Credits

I have used the following websites to help me build this project and write this Readme

GitHub Docs to find out extra information needed to clone the project using the Clone with HTTPS, SSH and CLI. The website address is: https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/using-git/which-remote-url-should-i-use
